Clam is a simple web application I made for students in my school to retrieve course timetables efficiently.
It uses simple queries to a sqlite3 DB to filter courses, and it also notifies students if any course times
are clashing.

You can demo the app here: http://clam.pythonanywhere.com

update: My free subscription for Python Anywhere has expired. Working on a solution.

So here are some screenshots instead:
